### Stream processing
For introductory purposes, a stream is a sequence of data items that are conceptually produced one at a time
개념적으로 한 번에 하나씩 생성된 아이템의 일련의 데이터다.
A program might read items from an input stream one by one and similarly write items to an output stream. The output stream of one program could well be the input stream of another.
input stream에 쓰고, output stream으로 읽는다.

Java 8 adds a Streams API (note the uppercase S) in java.util.stream.

Complex boilerplate code can be written more concisely.
```
Map<Conrrency, List<Transaction>> transactionsByCurrencies = 
  transactions.stream()
              .filter((Transaction t) -> t.getPrice() > 1000)
              .collect(groupingBy(Transaction::getCurrency));
```

Streams allows and encourages the elements within a Stream to be processed in parallel.
```
List<Apple> heavyApples = inventory.parallelStream().filter((Apple a) -> a.getWeight() > 150).collect(toList());
```

### Passing code to methods with behavior parameterization

methods as an argument.
```Java
File[] hiddenFiles = new File(".").listFiles(File::isHidden);
```
using lambdas
```Java
filterApples(inventory, (Apple a) -> "green".equals(a.getColor()) );
```


### Parallelism and shared mutable data
